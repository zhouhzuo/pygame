Purpose of the Software
This software is a digital implementation of the traditional board game, Gomoku, where two players take turns placing stones on a 19x19 grid, aiming to line up five stones in a row. The software is designed to provide both a challenging AI opponent and the option for two players to compete against each other.



Software Development Process
We applied the Agile development process for this project. Agile was chosen over Waterfall due to its flexibility and efficiency in handling projects with varying requirements and potential for frequent requirement changes. Agile allows for iterative development, enabling continuous evaluation of application functionality through regular sprints and adaptations.
requirement analysis and definition: we have done some researches for gobang game and decide what kind of software we would like to develop.
Designï¼šwe design the interface and functions then choose heuristic algorithms
implementtation: we wrote the source code to establish the app
test: we run the programme in different forms and record it in the demo video clip
maintainance:we will do the maintainance job regularly

Target Market
This software is aimed at users interested in board games, specifically those who enjoy strategy and tactical games. It caters to a wide age range, providing a challenging yet accessible platform for both new and experienced players of Gomoku.

Software Development Plan
Development Process
The project follows Agile methodologies with bi-weekly sprints to manage development tasks such as design, implementation, testing, and deployment effectively.

Members(Ceci, Yulia, Sunny, May)
Project Manager: Oversees project progress, ensures deadlines are met.
Developer: Handles the software coding and debugging.
Designer: Responsible for UI/UX design, ensuring the game is user-friendly.
QA Tester: Ensures the software is bug-free and performs as expected.


Schedule
Sprint 1: Setup project, basic game design (Weeks 1-2)
Sprint 2: Implement core game functionality (Weeks 3-4)
Sprint 3: Develop AI opponent (Weeks 5-6)
Sprint 4: Testing and feedback (Weeks 7-8)
Final Review and Launch: Preparation for public release (Week 9)


Algorithm
The AI uses a heuristic algorithm, evaluating the board based on predefined patterns (cdata). It prioritizes moves by their potential to either create a line of five stones or block the opponent from doing so, optimizing play as the game progresses.

Current Status
The current version of the software allows for single-player against AI and a two-player mode. The graphical user interface is fully functional, and the AI can compete at a basic level.

Future Plan
Enhance AI Algorithm: Improve the sophistication of the AI to provide more challenging gameplay.
Online Multiplayer Mode: Implement networked multiplayer capabilities.
Mobile Compatibility: Adapt the software for mobile platforms to reach a broader audience.
Conclusion
This README provides a detailed overview of our Gomoku game software. We are committed to continuous improvement and welcome feedback from all users to enhance the gaming experience.
